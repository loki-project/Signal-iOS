    // Some important points regarding reading from the database:
    //
    // • Background threads should use `OWSPrimaryStorage`'s `dbReadConnection`, whereas the main thread should use `OWSPrimaryStorage`'s `uiDatabaseConnection` (see the `YapDatabaseConnectionPool` documentation for more information).
    // • Multiple read transactions can safely be executed at the same time.

    // MARK: Writing

    // Some important points regarding writing to the database:
    //
    // • There can only be a single write transaction per database at any one time, so all write transactions must use `OWSPrimaryStorage`'s `dbReadWriteConnection`.
    // • Executing a write transaction from within a write transaction causes a deadlock and must be avoided.
